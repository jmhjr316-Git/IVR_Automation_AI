# Working Configuration Notes

## Current Status
The IVR Q Navigator is now working correctly with the following key features:
- Direct connection to Amazon Q Session API
- Simplified extraction logic that takes the last line of the response
- No additional context or formatting added to prompts
- Support for multi-digit IVR inputs

## Key Components
- `ivr-navigator.js`: Interactive tool for testing IVR navigation
- `ivr-auto-navigator.js`: Framework for automated IVR testing
- `ivr-integration.js`: Integration with real IVR systems
- `run-ivr-test.js`: Script to run automated IVR tests

## Extraction Logic
The working extraction logic is very simple - it just takes the last line of the Amazon Q response:

```javascript
extractAction(response) {
  // Split by newlines, trim whitespace, and filter out empty lines
  const lines = response.split('\n').map(line => line.trim()).filter(line => line);
  
  // Get the last non-empty line
  const lastLine = lines[lines.length - 1] || '';
  
  return lastLine;
}
```

## Multi-Digit Input Handling
For multi-digit inputs to the IVR system, we split the input into two separate calls:
1. First call sends only the first digit
2. Second call sends the remaining digits

This is necessary because the IVR system requires this pattern for multi-digit inputs.

```javascript
// For multi-digit inputs, we need to split them
if (/^\d{2,}$/.test(action)) {
  const firstDigit = action.charAt(0);
  const remainingDigits = action.substring(1);
  
  // Send the first digit
  response = await this.ivrTester.sendDtmf(firstDigit);
  
  // Wait for IVR to process
  await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, waitTime));
  
  // Send the remaining digits
  response = await this.ivrTester.sendDtmf(remainingDigits);
}
```

## API Integration
The tool connects directly to the Amazon Q Session API at http://localhost:8081 and sends raw IVR prompts without any additional formatting or context.

## Known Issues
