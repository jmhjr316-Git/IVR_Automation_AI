# Working Configuration Notes

## Current Status
The IVR Q Navigator is now working correctly with the following key features:
- Direct connection to Amazon Q Session API
- Simplified extraction logic that takes the last line of the response
- No additional context or formatting added to prompts

## Key Components
- `ivr-navigator.js`: Interactive tool for testing IVR navigation
- `ivr-auto-navigator.js`: Framework for automated IVR testing

## Extraction Logic
The working extraction logic is very simple - it just takes the last line of the Amazon Q response:

```javascript
extractAction(response) {
  // Split by newlines, trim whitespace, and filter out empty lines
  const lines = response.split('\n').map(line => line.trim()).filter(line => line);
  
  // Get the last non-empty line
  const lastLine = lines[lines.length - 1] || '';
  
  return lastLine;
}
```

## API Integration
The tool connects directly to the Amazon Q Session API at http://localhost:8081 and sends raw IVR prompts without any additional formatting or context.

## Known Issues
- None at this time
